# Fizz Buzz #2
# Write a function to print all numbers 1 to n, but there are some constraints
# If the number is divisible by 3, print 'Fizz' instead of the number
# If the number is divisible 5, print 'Buzz' instead of the number
# If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print 'FizzBuzz' instead of the number
# Otherwise, simply print the number
